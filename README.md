# The Club Checker

## What is the Club Checker?
The Club Checker is a tool that can be used for licenced premesis to check people coming into the venue. 
The checker has 2 area:
1. ID Check
2. Banned people

### ID Check
The ID Check asks the user to input the following information:
- A Person's name 
- A Person's age
- The ID that the person presented
- A person's Date of Birth

It then states wether the person is allowed in the club or not. 

### Banned people 

The banned people secrtion of the program has 3 options:

1. View Banned People
2. Add Banned People 
3. Remove Banned People

## Getting Started
The Program runs from a commang line interface (CLI).

Please follow below on how to start the program:

- Download and decompress the "Club" File to your chosen location.
- On your keyboard type: `windows key + r'
navigate to the club file in the CLI. 
Then Type the following:
```python main.py```

>Important note: The program gets your to enter a password to end session. This is to prevent accidental log out. Currently the password is set to ```Pa$$w0rd```. 

## Future developmemnt

I will be doing research into intergrating a user interface with this program. so if there are any contributers out there, then by all means please raise an issue to make contact. Thank you
